# Loans, Amortization, and General Payment Schedules

## Introduction

Loan amortization is a direct application of equations of value and
annuities. A loan is not merely an initial debt followed by periodic
payments. Actuarially, it is a cash-flow system that must remain
consistent with an interest-rate basis, a payment frequency, and a rule
for reducing the outstanding balance.

The central object is therefore not the amortization table itself, but
the financial identity that each row must satisfy.

If B\_{t-1} is the outstanding balance at the beginning of period t, I_t
the interest charged during the period, R_t the regular payment, E_t an
extra principal payment, and B_t the ending balance, then

B_t = B\_{t-1}+I_t-R_t-E_t.

If i_t is the effective rate for period t,

I_t=i_tB\_{t-1},

so

\boxed{ B_t = B\_{t-1}(1+i_t)-R_t-E_t }.

This recurrence is the basis of every schedule developed in this
vignette. `tidyactuarial` is used after the financial structure has been
established, so that the schedule remains an auditable sequence of
equations rather than an automatic table.

## A level-payment loan

Suppose a loan of amount L is repaid by n equal end-of-period payments R
at effective rate i per payment period.

At origination,

L = R\\a\_{\overline{n}\|i},

hence

\boxed{ R = \frac{L}{a\_{\overline{n}\|i}} = L \frac{ i }{ 1-(1+i)^{-n}
} }.

Consider a loan of 50,000 repaid monthly over five years. The
contractual rate is a nominal annual interest rate of 12\\ convertible
monthly.

The effective monthly rate is

i_p = \frac{0.12}{12} = 0.01,

and the number of payments is

n=5(12)=60.

Therefore,

50{,}000 = R\\a\_{\overline{60}\|0.01},

and

R \approx 1{,}112.22.

The annuity factor can be reproduced directly:

``` r

loan_principal <- 50000
loan_term_years <- 5
payments_per_year <- 12
nominal_rate <- 0.12
number_payments <- 60

annuity_factor <-
  a_angle(
    n = loan_term_years,
    k = payments_per_year,
    i = nominal_rate,
    i_type = "nominal_interest",
    m = 12,
    timing = "immediate"
  )

level_payment <-
  loan_principal /
  annuity_factor

level_payment
#> [1] 1112.222
```

The payment is determined by the equation of value. The schedule comes
later.

## Interest, principal repayment, and the balance recurrence

For a level-payment loan without extra principal payments,

B_t = B\_{t-1}(1+i)-R.

The interest charged in period t is

I_t = iB\_{t-1},

while the principal repaid through the regular payment is

A_t = R-I_t.

Therefore,

B_t = B\_{t-1}-A_t.

For the first month of the loan above,

I_1 = 50{,}000(0.01) = 500,

so

A_1 = 1{,}112.22-500 = 612.22,

and

B_1 = 50{,}000-612.22 = 49{,}387.78.

In the second month, interest is calculated on the new outstanding
balance, not on the original principal.

The regular payment remains constant, but its composition changes
through time: interest decreases while principal repayment increases.

## Prospective and retrospective balances

The outstanding balance after t payments can be obtained prospectively
by valuing the remaining payments:

\boxed{ B_t = R\\a\_{\overline{n-t}\|i} }.

The same balance can be obtained retrospectively by accumulating the
original loan and subtracting the accumulated value of the payments
already made:

\boxed{ B_t = L(1+i)^t - R\\s\_{\overline{t}\|i} }.

For the 50,000 loan, after 12 monthly payments,

B\_{12} \approx 42{,}235.49.

These two formulas are not different valuation methods. They are two
views of the same financial position.

The computational schedule provides a third audit:

``` r

level_schedule <-
  amort_schedule(
    principal = loan_principal,
    n = number_payments,
    i = nominal_rate,
    i_type = "nominal_interest",
    m = 12,
    k = payments_per_year,
    timing = "immediate"
  )

level_schedule |>
  dplyr::filter(
    period %in% c(1, 2, 12, 24, 60)
  ) |>
  dplyr::select(
    period,
    ob_start,
    interest,
    payment,
    principal,
    ob_end
  )
#> # A tibble: 5 × 6
#>   period ob_start interest payment principal ob_end
#>    <int>    <dbl>    <dbl>   <dbl>     <dbl>  <dbl>
#> 1      1   50000     500.    1112.      612. 49388.
#> 2      2   49388.    494.    1112.      618. 48769.
#> 3     12   42919.    429.    1112.      683. 42235.
#> 4     24   34256.    343.    1112.      770. 33486.
#> 5     60    1101.     11.0   1112.     1101.     0
```

Each row should satisfy

B_t = B\_{t-1}+I_t-R_t.

That identity is the primary audit of the schedule.

## Extra principal payments

An extra principal payment changes the outstanding balance immediately.

If an extra payment E_t is made together with the regular payment,

B_t = B\_{t-1}(1+i)-R_t-E_t.

Once the balance has been reduced, there are at least two common
policies:

- keep the regular payment and shorten the remaining term;
- keep the contractual term and recalculate the future regular payment.

Consider the same 50,000 loan with extra principal payments of 5,000 at
month 12 and 3,000 at month 24.

``` r

extra_principal <- c(
  "12" = 5000,
  "24" = 3000
)

schedule_term <-
  amort_schedule(
    principal = loan_principal,
    n = number_payments,
    i = nominal_rate,
    i_type = "nominal_interest",
    m = 12,
    k = payments_per_year,
    timing = "immediate",
    extra_principal = extra_principal,
    adjust = "term"
  )

schedule_payment <-
  amort_schedule(
    principal = loan_principal,
    n = number_payments,
    i = nominal_rate,
    i_type = "nominal_interest",
    m = 12,
    k = payments_per_year,
    timing = "immediate",
    extra_principal = extra_principal,
    adjust = "payment"
  )
```

Under `adjust = "term"`, the regular payment is maintained and the loan
ends earlier.

Under `adjust = "payment"`, the contractual horizon is maintained and
the future payment is recalculated after each extra principal payment.

For this example, the main financial results are approximately:

| Scenario           | Number of payments | Total interest | Total paid |
|--------------------|-------------------:|---------------:|-----------:|
| No extra principal |                 60 |      16,733.34 |  66,733.34 |
| Shorter term       |                 50 |      12,961.91 |  62,961.91 |
| Lower payment      |                 60 |      14,826.08 |  64,826.08 |

Both policies reduce total interest relative to the original schedule.
The shorter-term policy generates the larger interest saving because the
balance remains exposed to interest for less time. The lower-payment
policy has a different objective: it reduces the borrower’s future
cash-flow burden.

The choice is therefore not only an arithmetic comparison. It may also
be a liquidity and risk-management decision.

A compact audit can be produced directly from the schedules:

``` r

summary_original <-
  level_schedule |>
  dplyr::summarise(
    scenario = "No extra principal",
    number_payments = dplyr::n(),
    total_interest = sum(interest),
    total_paid = sum(cashflow),
    ending_balance = dplyr::last(ob_end)
  )

summary_term <-
  schedule_term |>
  dplyr::summarise(
    scenario = "Shorter term",
    number_payments = dplyr::n(),
    total_interest = sum(interest),
    total_paid = sum(cashflow),
    ending_balance = dplyr::last(ob_end)
  )

summary_payment <-
  schedule_payment |>
  dplyr::summarise(
    scenario = "Lower payment",
    number_payments = dplyr::n(),
    total_interest = sum(interest),
    total_paid = sum(cashflow),
    ending_balance = dplyr::last(ob_end)
  )

dplyr::bind_rows(
  summary_original,
  summary_term,
  summary_payment
)
#> # A tibble: 3 × 5
#>   scenario           number_payments total_interest total_paid ending_balance
#>   <chr>                        <int>          <dbl>      <dbl>          <dbl>
#> 1 No extra principal              60         16733.     66733.              0
#> 2 Shorter term                    50         12962.     62962.              0
#> 3 Lower payment                   60         14826.     64826.              0
```

## General payment schedules

The level-payment model is only one possible structure.

More generally, a loan may have:

- period-specific interest rates;
- non-level regular payments;
- extra principal payments that vary by period;
- payment rules that depend on the current outstanding balance.

The recurrence remains

\boxed{ B_t = B\_{t-1}(1+i_t)-R_t-E_t }.

What changes is the rule used to define i_t, R_t, and E_t.

[`amort_schedule_general()`](https://julianfajardo1908.github.io/tidyactuarial/reference/amort_schedule_general.md)
represents this broader problem directly. In `tidyactuarial 0.1.6`, the
interest-rate input may be a scalar or a vector with one rate
specification per period, while `payment` may be calculated
automatically, supplied as a scalar or vector, or defined as a function
of the current loan state.

## A loan with changing interest rates

Suppose a six-year loan of 120,000 is repaid by equal annual payments,
but the annual effective interest rate changes each year:

4\\,\\5\\,\\6\\,\\7\\,\\8\\,\\9\\.

The usual level-annuity formula cannot be applied with a single rate.
Instead, the payment R must satisfy

120{,}000 = R \sum\_{t=1}^{6} \prod\_{h=1}^{t} (1+i_h)^{-1}.

For these rates, the sum of discount factors is approximately

4.982057,

so

R \approx 24{,}086.43.

The changing-rate schedule can be built directly:

``` r

variable_rates <- c(
  0.04,
  0.05,
  0.06,
  0.07,
  0.08,
  0.09
)

variable_rate_schedule <-
  amort_schedule_general(
    principal = 120000,
    n = 6,
    i = variable_rates,
    i_type = "effective",
    k = 1,
    payment = NULL,
    timing = "immediate"
  )

variable_rate_schedule |>
  dplyr::select(
    period,
    ob_start,
    interest,
    payment,
    principal,
    ob_end
  )
#> # A tibble: 6 × 6
#>   period ob_start interest payment principal  ob_end
#>    <int>    <dbl>    <dbl>   <dbl>     <dbl>   <dbl>
#> 1      1  120000     4800.  24086.    19286. 100714.
#> 2      2  100714.    5036.  24086.    19051.  81663.
#> 3      3   81663.    4900.  24086.    19187.  62476.
#> 4      4   62476.    4373.  24086.    19713.  42763.
#> 5      5   42763.    3421.  24086.    20665.  22098.
#> 6      6   22098.    1989.  24086.    22098.      0
```

The software is useful here because the financial structure is no longer
a single geometric annuity. Each payment is discounted through the
sequence of rates that precedes it.

## A payment rule that depends on the outstanding balance

A particularly useful case is a constant-principal amortization system.

Let a loan of principal L be repaid over n periods with the same amount
of principal repaid each period:

A = \frac{L}{n}.

At period t,

R_t = A+i_tB\_{t-1}.

Thus the regular payment is not level. It is a rule that depends on the
current outstanding balance.

For the 50,000 loan over 60 months at a monthly effective rate of 1\\,

A = \frac{50{,}000}{60} = 833.33.

The first payment is

R_1 = 833.33+0.01(50{,}000) = 1{,}333.33,

while the final payment is approximately

R\_{60} = 841.67.

This structure can be expressed directly as a payment function:

``` r

fixed_principal <-
  loan_principal /
  number_payments

constant_principal_rule <- function(
  period,
  ob_start,
  i_effective_period
) {
  fixed_principal +
    i_effective_period * ob_start
}

constant_principal_schedule <-
  amort_schedule_general(
    principal = loan_principal,
    n = number_payments,
    i = nominal_rate,
    i_type = "nominal_interest",
    m = 12,
    k = payments_per_year,
    payment = constant_principal_rule,
    timing = "immediate"
  )

constant_principal_schedule |>
  dplyr::filter(
    period %in% c(1, 2, 12, 24, 60)
  ) |>
  dplyr::select(
    period,
    ob_start,
    interest,
    payment,
    principal,
    ob_end
  )
#> # A tibble: 5 × 6
#>   period ob_start interest payment principal ob_end
#>    <int>    <dbl>    <dbl>   <dbl>     <dbl>  <dbl>
#> 1      1   50000    500.     1333.      833. 49167.
#> 2      2   49167.   492.     1325       833. 48333.
#> 3     12   40833.   408.     1242.      833. 40000 
#> 4     24   30833.   308.     1142.      833. 30000 
#> 5     60     833.     8.33    842.      833.     0
```

This example is important because the code states the financial rule
directly:

\text{payment} = \text{fixed principal} + \text{interest on current
balance}.

The schedule is generated from the definition of the system rather than
from a precalculated vector of payments.

## Level payment versus constant principal

The two amortization systems repay the same original principal under the
same interest-rate basis, but the timing of principal repayment differs.

Under level payments, principal repayment begins relatively slowly and
increases through time.

Under constant principal, the same amount of principal is repaid every
period, so the outstanding balance decreases linearly and interest falls
more quickly.

For the 50,000 loan considered above, total interest under the
level-payment system is approximately

16{,}733.34,

while total interest under constant principal is

15{,}250.00.

The difference is approximately

1{,}483.34.

The reason is not the name of the repayment system. It is the time
profile of the outstanding balance: faster principal reduction produces
a smaller balance on which future interest is calculated.

## Negative amortization

The recurrence also identifies when a payment is insufficient to cover
the interest charged.

If

R_t\<i_tB\_{t-1},

then

A_t = R_t-i_tB\_{t-1} \< 0

and

B_t\>B\_{t-1}.

The unpaid portion of interest is added to the outstanding balance. This
is negative amortization.

[`amort_schedule_general()`](https://julianfajardo1908.github.io/tidyactuarial/reference/amort_schedule_general.md)
permits this situation when the supplied payment rule or payment vector
produces payments below the interest charged. The financial
interpretation should remain explicit: the loan balance is growing
because the contractual cash outflow is insufficient to cover current
interest.

Negative amortization is therefore not a software anomaly. It follows
directly from the balance recurrence.

## Final actuarial reading

Loan amortization can be summarized through a single dynamic identity:

B_t = B\_{t-1}(1+i_t)-R_t-E_t.

The familiar level-payment loan is obtained when i_t=i, R_t=R, and
E_t=0.

Extra principal payments modify E_t and may lead either to a shorter
term or to a lower future payment.

Variable-rate loans replace the single interest rate by a sequence
i_1,\ldots,i_n.

General payment systems replace the constant payment by a rule
R_t=R(t,B\_{t-1},i_t).

The progression is therefore

\text{equation of value} \longrightarrow \text{balance recurrence}
\longrightarrow \text{level schedule} \longrightarrow \text{prepayment
policy} \longrightarrow \text{general payment rule}.

[`amort_schedule()`](https://julianfajardo1908.github.io/tidyactuarial/reference/amort_schedule.md)
is appropriate when the rate specification is fixed and the main
extension is an extra-principal policy.

[`amort_schedule_general()`](https://julianfajardo1908.github.io/tidyactuarial/reference/amort_schedule_general.md)
becomes useful when rates, payments, or payment rules vary through time.

The package does not replace the loan equation. It makes the recurrence
reproducible when the schedule becomes too complex to reconstruct
manually period by period.
