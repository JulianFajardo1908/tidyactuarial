# tidyactuarial

**Actuarial mathematics in R with transparent formulas, reproducible workflows, and tidy outputs where they add value.**

`tidyactuarial` provides tools for financial mathematics and life contingencies in R. The package is designed so that the actuarial model remains visible: formulas, timing conventions, mortality assumptions, and valuation dates come first; computation is then used to reproduce, audit, and scale the calculation.

The stable release is **0.1.6** on CRAN. The development version is **0.1.6.9000**.

## Installation

Install the stable version from CRAN:

```r
install.packages("tidyactuarial")
```

Load the package with:

```r
library(tidyactuarial)
```

## What tidyactuarial covers

The package currently includes tools for:

- **Financial mathematics and interest rates:** accumulation, discounting, equivalent rates, present and future values, equations of value, cash-flow valuation, and IRR.
- **Annuities and loans:** level and varying annuities, amortization schedules, extra principal, variable rates, and general payment rules.
- **Bonds and interest-rate risk:** bond cash flows, price, yield, book value, callable bonds, duration, convexity, and portfolio measures.
- **Term structure and immunization:** spot discounting, forward rates, yield curves, duration matching, and duration-convexity immunization.
- **Life tables and survival:** life-table construction, fractional-age assumptions, survival and death probabilities, life expectancy, Kaplan-Meier estimation, and commutation functions.
- **Life contingencies:** life annuities, life insurance, premiums, reserves, and contract-based workflows.
- **Multiple-life and multiple-decrement models:** joint-life and last-survivor quantities, premiums, reserves, and cause-specific decrement calculations.
- **Simulation and actuarial risk:** lifetime simulation and Monte Carlo tools for annuities, insurance, premiums, reserves, losses, and multiple-life status models.

The full API is organized by actuarial area in the **Reference** section of the package website.

## A simple design principle

The package does not try to replace actuarial reasoning with software.

For a payment of amount $C$ at time $t$, financial valuation begins with

$$
PV = C(1+i)^{-t}.
$$

For a payment contingent on survival of a life aged $x$, the corresponding actuarial structure becomes

$$
{}_tE_x
=
v^t\,{}_tp_x.
$$

`tidyactuarial` keeps these quantities explicit and then provides functions that make the same calculations easier to reproduce across scenarios, portfolios, contracts, and datasets.

## Quick start

### Interest-rate conversion and valuation

Different rate conventions can first be placed on a common annual-effective basis.

```r
library(tidyactuarial)
library(dplyr)
library(tibble)

rates <- tibble(
  product = c(
    "effective",
    "nominal interest",
    "force",
    "nominal discount"
  ),
  i = c(
    0.0620,
    0.0605,
    0.0605,
    0.0590
  ),
  i_type = c(
    "effective",
    "nominal_interest",
    "force",
    "nominal_discount"
  ),
  m = c(
    1,
    12,
    1,
    4
  )
)

rates |>
  mutate(
    i_effective = standardize_interest(
      i_type = i_type,
      i = i,
      m = m
    ),
    value_6y = future_value(
      C = 25000,
      i = i_effective,
      t = 6
    )
  )
```

This pattern is useful when actuarial assumptions arrive in heterogeneous forms but the valuation model requires a common basis.

### General loan schedules

For a loan balance $B_{t-1}$, interest $I_t$, scheduled payment $R_t$, and extra principal $E_t$,

$$
B_t
=
B_{t-1}
+
I_t
-
R_t
-
E_t.
$$

A standard amortization schedule can be generated directly:

```r
amort_schedule(
  principal = 50000,
  n = 5,
  i = 0.12,
  i_type = "nominal_interest",
  m = 12,
  k = 12
)
```

When rates or payment rules vary over time, `amort_schedule_general()` provides the more flexible engine.

```r
principal <- 120000
rates <- c(
  0.04,
  0.05,
  0.06,
  0.07,
  0.08,
  0.09
)

amort_schedule_general(
  principal = principal,
  n = 6,
  i = rates,
  payment = NULL
)
```

### Bond valuation and interest-rate risk

```r
price <- bond_price(
  face = 1000,
  c = 0.05,
  n = 10,
  k = 2,
  y = 0.06,
  y_type = "effective"
)

duration <- bond_duration(
  face = 1000,
  c = 0.05,
  n = 10,
  k = 2,
  y = 0.06,
  y_type = "effective"
)

convexity <- bond_convexity(
  face = 1000,
  c = 0.05,
  n = 10,
  k = 2,
  y = 0.06,
  y_type = "effective"
)

tibble(
  price = price,
  duration = duration,
  convexity = convexity
)
```

The package uses the same actuarial specification to move from bond price to duration and convexity.

### From a life table to a premium

```r
data("soa08lt")

premium_x(
  lt = soa08lt,
  x = 40,
  i = 0.05,
  type = "term",
  benefit = 100000,
  n = 20,
  k = 12,
  n_prem = 10,
  output = "summary"
)
```

The same contract can be assembled progressively:

```r
soa08lt |>
  life_contract(
    lives = "single",
    x = 40,
    i = 0.05
  ) |>
  add_insurance(
    type = "term",
    benefit = 100000,
    n = 20
  ) |>
  add_premium_schedule(
    k = 12,
    n_prem = 10,
    timing = "due"
  ) |>
  premium_x(
    output = "summary"
  )
```

The pipe records the actuarial construction of the contract; it does not replace the underlying equation of equivalence.

## Articles

Four introductory articles develop complete workflows rather than isolated function calls:

- **Financial Mathematics with tidyactuarial**
- **Loans, Amortization, and General Payment Schedules**
- **Bonds, Duration, Convexity, and Immunization**
- **Life Contingencies with tidyactuarial**

They are available from the **Articles** menu of the package website.

## Output philosophy

Not every actuarial result needs to be a tibble.

`tidyactuarial` uses several output patterns depending on the task:

- direct numerical values for simple actuarial quantities;
- tidy one-row summaries when intermediate quantities are useful;
- schedules for loans, bonds, reserves, and related time-dependent calculations;
- portfolio-level summaries for grouped financial positions;
- pipe-friendly contract objects for life-contingency workflows.

This keeps simple calculations simple while allowing larger analyses to remain inspectable and reproducible.

## Reliability

The package is developed with automated unit and regression tests. The development branch is also checked through continuous integration on Linux, Windows, and macOS.

For released work where stability is the priority, use the CRAN version.

## Documentation

Function-level documentation is available from R:

```r
help(package = "tidyactuarial")
?standardize_interest
?amort_schedule_general
?bond_price
?annuity_x
?premium_x
?reserve_x
```

The package website provides:

- **Reference:** functions organized by actuarial area;
- **Articles:** worked actuarial workflows;
- **Changelog:** package development history.

## Reporting problems

Bug reports and reproducible examples are welcome through the project issue tracker.

For numerical issues, include whenever possible:

- the function call;
- all relevant inputs;
- the expected actuarial result;
- the observed result;
- `sessionInfo()`.
